# Kaggle in-class competition

*Performance Modeling*

* **Programming languages:**  `python3.7`

* **Required third party packages:**

  `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `xgboost`

  I have output my virtual env packages list to requirement.txt, but it maybe import other packages which are not related to this project.

* **How to run it:** 

  * Open [performance_modeling.ipynb](http://localhost:8889/notebooks/performance_modeling.ipynb) with `jupyter notebook`
  * Choose the kernel with correct python environment
  * Press restart and re-run button
  * check the output file in the same directory

* **PS:** 

  * All data files are under `./data/` directory.

  * I noted all my explonary code to make sure my code can be run directly.

    The explonary procedure is important to get the final answer, I didn't delete them.

    So forgive me if you see lots of comments in the file.

    If code cannot be re-ran, please let me know.
